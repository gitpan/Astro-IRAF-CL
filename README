Astro::IRAF::CL
===============

This is a Perl module that provides an object-orientated interface to
the IRAF CL interactive session, it is built on top of the Perl Expect
module. You can script almost anything through this module that you
can do in a normal interactive CL session.

This module provides several improved, and more Perl-like, interfaces
to various IRAF systems, such as session variables, the management of
loading/unloading IRAF packages and the session history. It also
provides the ability to specify maximum run times for commands, and
the clean handling of these time outs and other types of errors and
exceptions. All functions are called in an object-orientated fashion
allowing several concurrent interpreter sessions if desired.

Requirements
------------

This module requires:

Perl 5.6.1
Expect 1.15

Expect requires IO::Tty 1.0 and suggests IO::Stty

It also requires a fully working IRAF system, it is known to work with
version 2.11.3 on Solaris, Linux and Alpha machines. It may work with
other versions of IRAF on other architectures, let me know if it does!

Installation
------------

The standard method for installing a Perl module holds here:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

This will install everything into /usr/local as a default. If you want
to change this the easiest way is to use the LIB variable when
creating the makefile, for example:

perl Makefile.PL LIB=/home/foo/perlmods

for more configuration options see " perldoc ExtUtils::MakeMaker"

Note that, at present, there is no test system so "make test" won't do
anything useful.
