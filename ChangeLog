Astro::IRAF::CL (0.2.0) stable;

  * Added a locking system for the IRAF start directory that the module
    uses, without this two objects using the same start directory and
    IRAF commands could encounter parameter collision resulting in a
    CL crash. Or worse could result in your data being badly screwed,
    to my mind this is an IRAF problem that I am just working around.
	
  * Added a very simple interrupt (ctrl-c) handler as for some reason
    DESTROY() was not being called if a script was prematurely ended 
    using ctrl-c. All it does is call die() which does the right thing.

Astro::IRAF::CL (0.1.2) stable;

  * Added a warning_handler to the exec() routine, by default it just
    prints out the warning and continues.
  * Fixed the mycl example script which had a couple of errors
